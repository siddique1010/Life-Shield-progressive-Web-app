Life-Shield Safety Web App (First Semester Project)

Life-Shield is a front-end safety-focused web application developed as a first-semester academic project for the AICT program. The project demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design an interactive, multi-screen web interface aimed at personal safety awareness and emergency preparedness.

The application includes an Emergency (SOS) screen with a large alert button that retrieves the user’s live location using the browser’s Geolocation API and displays it on an OpenStreetMap (Leaflet) map for demonstration purposes. No real emergency services or authorities are contacted.

Additional modules include:

Safe Journey Planner to locally store trip details, risk level, and trusted contact information

Harassment / Incident Reporting form for recording incident details and evidence notes

User Feedback / Comments section supporting multiple stored entries

Safety Tips screen providing basic personal safety guidance

All data is stored locally in the browser using LocalStorage. The application does not use any backend, database, authentication, or real-time communication, and it is not connected to police, rescue services, or government systems.

This project focuses on:

Responsive UI design

Client-side form handling and validation

Browser APIs (Geolocation, LocalStorage)

Single-page navigation using vanilla JavaScript
